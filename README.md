# Nextgen_Local_adaptation_paper_202308
This repository includes the main scripts used to analyse re-sequencing data of sheep and goats in Morocco to identify putative genomic variants and genes involved in local adaptaion to eco-climatic constraints.
These scripts were used to identify variants under selection over sheep and goat genomes using xp-clr and Fst and to group the results
